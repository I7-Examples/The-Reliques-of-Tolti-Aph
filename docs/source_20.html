The stubborn wiry trees are everywhere. Instead of doing something to the stubborn wiry trees, say &quot;<span class="quote">The trees are everywhere, and while they are now the fabric of the city they are also in a sense foreign to it. They need not concern you.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">forest</span>&quot; as the stubborn wiry trees.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Longwall Street is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">Almost overgrown in the deep forest, collapsed and at once standing, the cyclopean east-west Longwall of the fallen city sinks here to a mostly flat, lichened stone clearing: it must once have been a customs post. To the west, an old wall turret like a broken chess piece still seems enterable by a dark doorway, whereas the eastern side of the wall's gap is only a shapeless ramp of masonry. Northwards, to what was once the interior, stubborn, wiry trees grapple with ancient pavings.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The player is in Longwall Street.

Likely to fall at the touch of your little finger, no.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Before going inside in Longwall Street, try going west instead. Before entering the old wall turret, try going west instead.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Writing it on is an action applying to one topic and one thing.

A level 5 magic-user, with genuine experience points to your name! Okay, so if anyone ever bowed to a level 5 mage, the light was bad: and you seem just as prone to trip over creepers and stumble into trees as ever you were: but you are now a force to be reckoned with, and if nothing else, you'll always have the memory of Tolti-Aph.</span>&quot;;</p><p class="indent1">end the game saying &quot;<span class="quote">You have won</span>&quot;.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The Stone Mound is east of Longwall Street. &quot;<span class="quote">The remains of the Longwall rise steeply up eastward of the curious ruined platform, and also lose their shape, becoming little more than a great stone mound. Here at the top, it looks as if the stonework has been shattered by lightning and not just slow old time, but that seems an unreal idea when the canopies of the forest stretch out in every direction against a clear autumnal-blue sky.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Instead of going nowhere from the Stone Mound, say &quot;<span class="quote">The only safe way down the Mound is back to westward.</span>&quot; Down from the Stone Mound is the Longwall Street.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Before going to the Stone Mound: if the strength of the player is less than 3, say &quot;<span class="quote">You are too weak now to contemplate making such a climb.</span>&quot; instead.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">After going to the Stone Mound: say &quot;<span class="quote">It is a long, steep climb up the ragged eastern side of the Longwall breach, and costs you 1 strength point.</span>&quot;; decrease the strength of the player by 1; continue the action.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">A barbed feather is in the Stone Mound. &quot;<span class="quote">A barbed metallic feather, from a bird which must have been scaly and very large - also, disconcertingly, metallic - lies in the loose rubble.</span>&quot; The feather is metal. The description of the feather is &quot;<span class="quote">The feather comes to a metal tip which is - there's no other other word for it - a sort of nib.</span>&quot; After taking the feather for the first time, say &quot;<span class="quote">Taken. As the feather pulls clear, it occurs to you that the rubble it was sitting in is not any random cairn, but is all of the same kind of stone, and has smooth as well as roughened faces. It's thoroughly broken up now, whatever it was.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">fly</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">fly [</span><span class="substitution">text</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<span class="quote">Hmm. 'Magicians Who Thought They Could Fly' is a local delicacy back home - little tomato-pancakes dropped into a skillet of olive oil.</span>&quot;).</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The ornamental stone ball is pushable between rooms. Instead of taking the ornamental stone ball, say &quot;<span class="quote">It's almost as big as you, and made of stone.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The loose rubble is scenery in the Stone Mound. Effect of casting mend at the loose rubble: remove the loose rubble from play; move the ornamental stone ball to the Stone Mound; record outcome &quot;<span class="quote">shaping it back into the ornamental stone ball which must once have stood atop the Longwall</span>&quot;; rule succeeds. Instead of taking the loose rubble, say &quot;<span class="quote">Whatever you came to this ruin for, it wasn't a handful of rubble.</span>&quot; Instead of pushing the stone ball, say &quot;<span class="quote">Try saying which way to push it.</span>&quot; After going from the Stone Mound with the ornamental stone ball: say &quot;<span class="quote">Wheeeeee!</span>&quot;; continue the action.

Understand &quot;<span class="quote">stonework</span>&quot; as the loose rubble.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Turret Roundhouse is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">This broad round chamber forms the central well of the turret. Little light enters by the dark doorway from the east, but the crude steps upward presumably lead to a lookout.</span>&quot; A scroll called the battered scroll is in the Turret Roundhouse. &quot;<span class="quote">Propped against one wall, almost as if it was meant for you to find it, is a battered scroll.</span>&quot; The inscribed spell of the battered scroll is make sanctuary.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Turret Alcove is above the Turret Roundhouse. A container called the medicine chest is in the Turret Alcove. &quot;<span class="quote">The rough steps - probably not the original construction - end at a blank-walled alcove, bare except for a medicine chest.</span>&quot; In the medicine chest is a strength potion called the green vial. The green vial has additional strength 1d6+2. In the medicine chest is a strength potion called the ochre vial. The ochre vial has additional strength 1d6+2.

The medicine chest is wood.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The arrowslit is fixed in place in the Turret Alcove. &quot;<span class="quote">A little light shows through a broad arrowslit in the northwestern wall of the turret, which is where the steps have wound around to.</span>&quot; The arrow is a wood thing. Instead of examining the arrowslit for the first time: say &quot;<span class="quote">As you look curiously out of the arrowslit, there is a wheep! sound. Instinctively, you dodge. </span>&quot;; if a saving roll of 11 by the player to &quot;<span class="quote">sidestep the arrow</span>&quot; is made begin; say &quot;<span class="quote">The arrow whings past you and rattles against the far wall of the Turret.</span>&quot;; now the arrow is in the Turret Roundhouse; otherwise; now the player carries the arrow; say &quot;<span class="quote">The arrow catches you in the shoulder</span>&quot;; make the player take 3 points of damage;<a name="note3ref"></a><span class="notecue"><a href="#note3">[3]</a></span> if the player is alive, say &quot;<span class="quote">You pull the arrow out ruefully.</span>&quot;; end if.

<p><span class="notesheading">Notes</span></p>
<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  Oh, the grief this trapped doorway caused. It's the first test case of the way this game is unlike conventional IF: because one can blunder through and, probably, just about survive to see the inside of the Turret, though one is then too weak to stand much chance of profiting from the experience. Players tended to assume that if they had got inside at all, then they must have "solved" the problem. Several hints were added to suggest otherwise. Another popular confusion was that players felt that "detect trap" ought also to defuse traps, so text was added to the spoof magazine which would in effect explain otherwise.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  This was intended to keep players on their toes: detect trap! detect trap! always detect trap!</span></p>
<p><a name="note3"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note3ref">[3]</a>.  It's almost certainly a good idea to be stoical and accept the 3 points of damage for the sake of getting something wooden which can be used as a spell focus later - so this is not a puzzle to be solved, but a treasure in disguise, really.</span></p>
