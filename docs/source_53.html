<p class="indent0"><span class="heading">Section N(b) - Rescued!</span></p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The Archive Chamber is a room. &quot;<span class="quote">A cellar, but hardly the cellar of an inn: that must have been a subterfuge. Here were stored the knowledge of spells of particular power or importance, those the possessors did not want to entrust to mere scrolls. Once coffins lined both sides of this room, but most are broken and empty, the inhabitants turned to dust: in some cases quite recently, since they broke your fall. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The single remaining coffin, sealed up by magical, half-transparent wood, contains a motionless figure.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The broken coffins are scenery in the Archive Chamber. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Their seals are broken and their contents dust.</span>&quot; Effect of casting mend at the broken coffins: record outcome &quot;<span class="quote">but cannot restore the many layers of ancient magic that sustained these intact</span>&quot;; rule succeeds. The broken coffins are wood.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The pair of infravision spectacles is in the Archive Chamber. &quot;<span class="quote">Dislodged by your fall, perhaps, a pair of infravision spectacles lies on the stone floor, the skull that once wore them being now only powder.</span>&quot; The description of the spectacles is &quot;<span class="quote">You see nothing special about the infravision spectacles. No, really, you never did see anything special in them. Okay, so darker-leaning magic users liked to wear them around town in an I'm-too-cool-for-sunlight pose, but really.</span>&quot; The spectacles are wearable. After looking when in darkness and the player is wearing the infravision spectacles, say &quot;<span class="quote">It's actually a myth that infravision spectacles enable you to see in the dark. They actually allow you to see light re-phasing around magical surfaces.</span>&quot; The infravision spectacles are metal.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The single remaining coffin is transparent closed scenery in the Archive Chamber. It contains a motionless figure. The figure is a woman. The figure knows summon elemental. The description of the motionless figure is &quot;<span class="quote">Her face is hatchet-like, her brows straight in a way you have seen only in statues. But she breathes. Very slowly, but she breathes.</span>&quot; Instead of opening the coffin, say &quot;<span class="quote">It is sealed with a powerful magic, protecting the life within.</span>&quot; Instead of entering the coffin, say &quot;<span class="quote">Standing on the coffin would take you no nearer the ceiling, in real terms, and as for entering it, the thing is shut tight: quite apart from any considerations of human decency.</span>&quot; The single remaining coffin is wood.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Instead of going up in the Archive Chamber, say &quot;<span class="quote">There is no apparent way of climbing up to the square hole in the vaulted ceiling of this cellar.</span>&quot; Instead of going nowhere from the Archive Chamber, say &quot;<span class="quote">You explore each corner of the cellar, hoping to find a way out. But it is very well secured against infestation, ground-water, thieves and the like.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">In the Archive Chamber is scenery thing called the square hole in the vaulted ceiling. The description of the square hole is &quot;<span class="quote">Through the square hole in the ceiling, you are tantalised by the fine afternoon sunshine: that etherial, simple perfection which is somehow appreciated only by those who see it from a prison cell.</span>&quot; Understand &quot;<span class="quote">door</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">trap</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">trap-door</span>&quot; and &quot;<span class="quote">trapdoor</span>&quot; as the square hole. The square hole is air.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The Prison Visit is a scene. The Prison Visit begins when the player is in the Archive Chamber for the ninth turn. The Prison Visit ends when the player is not in the Archive Chamber.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">tp [</span><span class="substitution">any room</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; as teleporting. teleporting is an action out of world applying to one thing.

Answering is making a rumpus. Singing is making a rumpus. Asking someone for something is making a rumpus.
