<br>
The Archive Chamber is a room. &quot;<font color=#000080>A cellar, but hardly the cellar of an inn: that must have been a subterfuge. Here were stored the knowledge of spells of particular power or importance, those the possessors did not want to entrust to mere scrolls. Once coffins lined both sides of this room, but most are broken and empty, the inhabitants turned to dust: in some cases quite recently, since they broke your fall. 
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>The single remaining coffin, sealed up by magical, half-transparent wood, contains a motionless figure.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The broken coffins are scenery in the Archive Chamber. The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>Their seals are broken and their contents dust.</font>&quot; Effect of casting mend at the broken coffins: record outcome &quot;<font color=#000080>but cannot restore the many layers of ancient magic that sustained these intact</font>&quot;; rule succeeds. The broken coffins are wood.
<br>

<br>
The pair of infravision spectacles is in the Archive Chamber. &quot;<font color=#000080>Dislodged by your fall, perhaps, a pair of infravision spectacles lies on the stone floor, the skull that once wore them being now only powder.</font>&quot; The description of the spectacles is &quot;<font color=#000080>You see nothing special about the infravision spectacles. No, really, you never did see anything special in them. Okay, so darker-leaning magic users liked to wear them around town in an I'm-too-cool-for-sunlight pose, but really.</font>&quot; The spectacles are wearable. After looking when in darkness and the player is wearing the infravision spectacles, say &quot;<font color=#000080>It's actually a myth that infravision spectacles enable you to see in the dark. They actually allow you to see light re-phasing around magical surfaces.</font>&quot; The infravision spectacles are metal.
<br>

<br>
The single remaining coffin is transparent closed scenery in the Archive Chamber. It contains a motionless figure. The figure is a woman. The figure knows summon elemental. The description of the motionless figure is &quot;<font color=#000080>Her face is hatchet-like, her brows straight in a way you have seen only in statues. But she breathes. Very slowly, but she breathes.</font>&quot; Instead of opening the coffin, say &quot;<font color=#000080>It is sealed with a powerful magic, protecting the life within.</font>&quot; Instead of entering the coffin, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Standing on the coffin would take you no nearer the ceiling, in real terms, and as for entering it, the thing is shut tight: quite apart from any considerations of human decency.</font>&quot; The single remaining coffin is wood.
<br>

<br>
Instead of going up in the Archive Chamber, say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is no apparent way of climbing up to the square hole in the vaulted ceiling of this cellar.</font>&quot; Instead of going nowhere from the Archive Chamber, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You explore each corner of the cellar, hoping to find a way out. But it is very well secured against infestation, ground-water, thieves and the like.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
In the Archive Chamber is scenery thing called the square hole in the vaulted ceiling. The description of the square hole is &quot;<font color=#000080>Through the square hole in the ceiling, you are tantalised by the fine afternoon sunshine: that etherial, simple perfection which is somehow appreciated only by those who see it from a prison cell.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>door</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>trap</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>trap-door</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>trapdoor</font>&quot; as the square hole. The square hole is air.
<br>

<br>
The Prison Visit is a scene. The Prison Visit begins when the player is in the Archive Chamber for the ninth turn. The Prison Visit ends when the player is not in the Archive Chamber.

Understand the commands &quot;<font color=#000080>yell</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>holler</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>answer</font>&quot;. Answering is making a rumpus. Singing is making a rumpus. Asking someone for something is making a rumpus. Instead of making a rumpus during the Prison Visit, say &quot;<font color=#000080>No matter how loudly you call out, the sound seems to be deadened by the funereal walls of this burial chamber.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Every turn during the Prison Visit:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through the Table of Prison Visit Noises Off

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise record outcome &quot;<font color=#000080>but although a plausible spider's-web does drape itself across the hole for a while, it doesn't last, and doesn't by any means hang a useful thread down to your level</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.

Effect of casting magic missile at the square hole:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;record outcome &quot;<font color=#000080>and a spectacular firework of a missile is fired into the afternoon air. It must get the attention of anyone around, surely? And your heart surges as one end of a forty-foot coil of rope is thrown down, and a vague shape from above gives a muffled yell, and you step onto the grappling hook to be pulled up, up, above the old coffins and over the lip of the trap-doorway to...
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Oh, well, isn't that just [italic type]exactly[roman type] like life? You leap backwards. So does your benefactor. The trap-door slams angrily shut, swallowing the rope as if it were so much spaghetti</font>&quot;;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rule succeeds.

Instead of listening during Prison Visit, say &quot;<font color=#000080>The trouble is, the harder you concentrate on listening, the more you hear your own heartbeat and breathing.</font>&quot;

<br>
Glog the Troll is a cave troll.<font color=#404040><sup><a href="#note2">[2]</a></sup></font>

This is the rescued from the archive rule:

					<p><font size="-1" face="Trebuchet MS, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, SunSans-Regular, sans-serif"><p><i>Notes</i><p>
<A name="note1"><font color=#404040>[1].  The repeat loop here is a bit misleading, since the "stop" means that it only ever looks at the top row of the table - but when we use up a row, we blank it out, so that next time the next row will be at the top. The effect is that the messages in the Table will be printed in sequence, once every turn, until all have been printed, and then nothing further happens.</font><p>
<A name="note2"><font color=#404040>[2].  Glog probably has romantic feelings too, and is probably just as annoyed by this outcome as the player is. Life is so terribly cruel.</font><p>
