<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  There are several obviously special labyrinth rooms, with exotic names and behaviour. These two rooms are less obviously special. They are T-junctions pointing into the maze, which will be placed just north and just south of the Hedge Archway respectively, and their purpose is to maximize the initial connectedness of the maze - they guarantee the explorer initial access to five possible rooms rather than the three which the Hedge Archway alone would lead into, and this decreases the chances of a boringly quick game in which the maze is fully blocked off in a couple of rooms.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  Play-testers generally assumed that this was the only way to reach the Island - which the player must of course do in order to win the "rescue Eurydice" quest. In fact, there are two other ways: to use the Magic Carpet to fly across the lake from any of the four shores, or to get lucky and find a staircase down from the room vertically above the island - or a staircase up from the room vertically below.</span></p>
