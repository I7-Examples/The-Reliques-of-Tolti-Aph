The Eye of God was differently cursed in the original: here it is dangerous to carry around, but one of the maze quests is exactly to carry it for a long way. Our version of the Ring is immensely powerful, but there is a catch: although the wearer becomes almost immortal on lower levels, he is likely to emerge back up to higher levels with dangerously low STR, so there is some danger of surviving a tussle with demons far below only to be knocked on the head by a gnome on level 1.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">No equivalent to the Divining Rod and the Enchanted Map exist in the original board game: nor could they, really, since the players could always see the entire labyrinth laid out on the floor.]</span></p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">An artefact is a kind of thing.
