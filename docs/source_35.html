If the player tries going east into Terra Incognita, say, a new room is placed at the appropriate grid position. If that new room has a connection back west, all well and good. If it doesn't, the player is stymied, and the original map connection changed to Solid Rock. But the new room is not removed again: instead, it waits in the labyrinth to be discovered from another side. (Such rooms were played as face-down cards in the original board game.) But what if the player never does discover another way in? They then remain unvisited forever.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="comment">Except that they don't, because we follow a procedure called retrieval to take such rooms back into the pack for further playing if the pack ever runs out.
