<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  This didn't occur to the author at all - one of the playtesters tried it, and then the idea seemed irresistable. Poisoning a weapon adds a whole extra die and +2 in adds, so there's quite a reward for anyone resourceful enough to think of this.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  An exceptionally unpopular rule with players, this. But it does make the reward for those who discover "make sanctuary" all the sweeter.</span></p>
