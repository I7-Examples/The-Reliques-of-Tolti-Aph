<br>

<br>
A room called In the Budless Grove is east of the Exalted Throne. &quot;<font color=#000080>These eastward demesnes were once formal gardens: none more formal, in fact, since they comprised the Maze of the Royal Beasts, the traditional proving-ground for mages who wished to be advanced in the king's service. Of the original structure, nothing remains except the trellis-work archway to the east, the bordering hedge obscuring all sight of what may lie within, the stone bench - in fact, more or less everything survives, it seems.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The Exalted Throne is up from the Budless Grove.
<br>

<br>
A ring of ghostly never-children is a person in the Budless Grove. &quot;<font color=#000080>But not perhaps by natural causes, for a ring of ghostly never-children, pallid things with shallow, violent eyes, join hands to dance and dance again around the bench.</font>&quot; Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>never</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>children</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>ghosts</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>pallid</font>&quot; as the never-children.
<br>

<br>
Instead of attacking the never-children, say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is an abrupt shifting of scale. The giggling of the children grows to a booming thunder, from far, far above.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Abruptly you realise that this is a fight which may begin while you are the height of a blade of recently-cut grass. Each of the never-children, you'd guess, has a STR of maybe 4, and you doubt if they could deal out more than 1d4 of damage between them. On the other hand you now have a STR of 1/10th...
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>So it's a lucky thing that, treating the episode as a game, they allow you to return to normal size. You step back involuntarily.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of kissing the never-children, say &quot;<font color=#000080>You might get close enough. Whether you'd get back again...</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The description of the never-children is &quot;<font color=#000080>As the name suggests, they were never children. They are not undead, for they never lived. They - well. Let's just leave it at that.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of giving something to the never-children, say &quot;<font color=#000080>'We doethn't want giftth!' they cry out in derision. This whole lisping thing is going to get old quite quickly. 'We demandth... thacrifithe.' Mmm.</font>&quot; Instead of asking the never-children about, say &quot;<font color=#000080>They yelp with amusement at the idea that they should answer your questions.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>sacrifice [something]</font>&quot; as a mistake (&quot;<font color=#000080>There are as many forms of sacrifice as there are minor cults. You will have to say how.</font>&quot;).
<br>

<br>
The stone bench is a scenery supporter in the Budless Grove.
<br>

<br>
The Orange Flower of the Postulant is a thing. Instead of rubbing the Orange Flower, say &quot;<font color=#000080>What, you think you can just rub it off? One born every minute.</font>&quot; The Orange Flower is flesh.
<br>

<br>
Instead of entering the archway in the Budless Grove, try going east.
<br>

<br>
The cowardice count is a number that varies. The never-children can be satisfied or unsatisfied. The never-children are unsatisfied.
<br>

<br>
Instead of attacking a scroll:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the noun from play;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You tear up [the noun], and it loses coherence as it melts into thinnest air. Apparently only magic really gave it any substance, and that is now gone.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is in the Budless Grove and the never-children are unsatisfied
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the never-children are satisfied;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>'The magic-uther tore up the [inscribed spell of the noun] all for uth!' one of the vile little creatures says, and the others make grudging gestures. 'All wight. Can come play.'</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>play</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>sing</font>&quot;. Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>dance</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>sing</font>&quot;. Instead of singing in the presence of the never-children, say &quot;<font color=#000080>The merest look from them would be enough to stop you, but in fact they give you quite a lot more than the merest look. At any rate - you stop.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of entering or climbing the stone bench:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the never-children are unsatisfied, say &quot;<font color=#000080>'We don't let jutht anyone play!' giggles one of the never-children. 'Firtht, you have to sacrifithe something. Something no magic-uther would ever sacrifithe.'</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is affected by compel postulant, say &quot;<font color=#000080>The never-children glower at you.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is affected by compel postulant;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the Orange Flower of the Postulant is part of the player;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restore the health of the player;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>As you sit, one of the ghostly never-children dabs your forehead with a practised brush, painting a flower motif. They chant in a patty-cake-like rhyme, 'Postu- postu- postulant, Now you are compelled!' and, what with all the mad, scamp-like laughter, you spend so long thinking about how ghastly they are as well as ghostly that you realise far too late that the rhyme is actually a spell. You jump up again, feeling too stupid to feel angry.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the cowardice count to 1;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 5 points.
<br>

<br>
Instead of casting magic missile at in the presence of the never-children, say &quot;<font color=#000080>'Who'th got a magic mithile then!' lisps one of the never-children unbearably, and their cackles become so monstrously elongated that, well, somehow you change your mind. Between them, they may be the most powerful sorcerer you have ever met.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Every turn when the player is in the Budless Grove and the cowardice count is not 0 and the maze victory count is 0:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the cowardice count by 1;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the cowardice count is 2, stop;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the cowardice count is 3, say &quot;<font color=#000080>One of the never-children slaps you in the face. 'Coward!'</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the cowardice count &gt; 3
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The never-children slap you harder, and there is a nastier overtone to their taunting. 'Coward! You must enter the Labyrinth!' The blow has real effect</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player is affected by aerial shield, say &quot;<font color=#000080>, and your aerial shield is no hope when they're reaching up from below</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the slap strength be the cowardice count;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decrease the slap strength by 3;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make the player take the slap strength points of damage;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
<br>

<br>
Before taking inventory: if the player is affected by compel postulant, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Your forehead bears the Orange Flower of the Postulant, age-old symbol of one held by the 'compel postulant' spell.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Before going to the Exalted Throne when the player is affected by compel postulant:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the maze victory count is 0, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Your forehead aches with greater agony as you take each step of the ziggurat, and you are eventually compelled to return.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player is not affected by compel postulant;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove the Orange Flower from play.
<br>

<br>
Instead of examining the Orange Flower:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player carries something metal (called the reflective surface), say &quot;<font color=#000080>In [the reflective surface] you see reflected the Orange Flower of the Postulant on your forehead, a pretty many-petalled flower like a saxifrage. You last saw one of these on, wait a moment, an old wood-panel in the unrenovated part of the Master Herbiarist's classroom. You used to look at this when he was collapsed by sneezing - why they appointed a Master Herbiarist with hay-fever, the gods only know - and now it comes back to you with an uneasy jolt: the brave young figure, Flower on forehead, setting off into the verdant maze, never seeing the three-necked Green Hydra waiting just behind the first corner.</font>&quot; instead;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>It seems to be fuzzy, thin and brownish. No - wait! Those are your eyebrows.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The trellis-work archway is an open trapped door. &quot;<font color=#000080>So-called because it is the work of Mrs Trellis of North Wales, an indefatigable witch.</font>&quot;<font color=#404040><sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup></font> The trellis-work archway is east of the Budless Grove and west of the Hedge Archway. The trellis-work archway is scenery. The trellis-work archway is wood.
<br>

<br>
Instead of going east in the Budless Grove when the player is not affected by compel postulant, say &quot;<font color=#000080>'Wanth to play in our garden of [number of labyrinth rooms in words] beds,' giggles one of the never-children. 'Can't!' screams another, then another. 'Not unleth...' They laugh, if by laugh we mean a thoroughly ill-intentioned threat.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
After going east from the Budless Grove: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You try your very hardest to remember what used to happen to postulants, once they had crossed the archway. All you can recall from the Master-Sage's lessons is that some insanely powerful geas protected the Maze's secrets by ensuring that if anyone were ever to be told the story of a postulant, even in another world, even if the story were being told by some kind of mechanical contraption - that any who listened or read would immediately suffer DEATH should the postulant in the story come to that same unhappy end.</font>&quot;; continue the action.
