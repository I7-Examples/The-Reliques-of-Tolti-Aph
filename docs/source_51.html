The hole is an open unopenable door. It is scenery. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>opening</font>&quot; as the hole. It is above the Knotted Room and below the Dim Garret. The printed name of Dim Garret is &quot;<font color=#000080>[if archivist is lit and archivist is in location]Brilliant[otherwise]Dim[end if] Garret</font>&quot;.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You look down into the room below, hoping your makeshift ladder will hold up for the return trip.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of searching the hole in the Knotted Room:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a lit thing is in the Garret, say &quot;<font color=#000080>White light and odd shadows are visible through the hole, but you can make out no more than that.</font>&quot;;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;<font color=#000080>It looks dark up there.</font>&quot;
<br>

Instead of casting mend at the portable cubbyholes when the cubbyholes are not in the location:

The archivist is a priest in the Dim Garret. It is indifferent. The archivist can be active or passive. &quot;<font color=#000080>Crouched in the center of the room, surrounded by filaments of various weights and colours, is an archivist[if lit]. He glows with magelight[end if].</font>&quot; The description is &quot;<font color=#000080>He is very thin, as though he has been preserved by drying, and wears small round spectacles[if lit]. He also glows with a flickering white light[end if].</font>&quot;  
<br>

<br>
Instead of going to the Garret when the player knows magelight and the archivist is unlit for the first time:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>You hesitate - after all, the old lunatic has probably gone out like a snuffed lamp by now, and if you head up there you may be required to re-light him.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of attacking the archivist: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You swing at him, but make no contact. 'Ah,' he says, 'you have come far too late to kill me, I fear.'</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Instead of going to a room in the presence of the unlit archivist when the player knows magelight:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;<font color=#000080>The archivist stops you with a sign that ripples in the air[if the archivist is affected by silence].
