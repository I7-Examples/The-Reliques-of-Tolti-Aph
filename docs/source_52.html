<b>Section N(a) - That Was Old School</b>
<br>

<br>
After going north from the Exalted Throne: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You climb down the steps to the far side of Tolti-Aph, which is still more tumbledown than the route in.</font>&quot;; continue the action.
<br>

<br>
Old School Yard is north of the Exalted Throne. &quot;<font color=#000080>This was never a place of education, except it was. Today an overgrown spoil-heap of fallen columns, maybe, but you are pretty sure it is the same yard engraved in the frontispiece of Reliques of Tolti-Aph.
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>
<br>
</font><font color=#000080>Of the 'Old School' inn, notorious haunt of liars and braggarts, time has swept everything away except a few stone columns[if the jumble is in Old School]: and even those it has tumbled into an unruly clump, like the corn-stook of a drunken harvester[otherwise], which lie segmented all about you[end if].</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
Up from the Old School Yard is the Exalted Throne. Instead of going nowhere from Old School Yard, say &quot;<font color=#000080>It's sad how little remains of this once-thriving northern quarter of the city: little more than what you see.</font>&quot;
<br>

<br>
The wooden trap-door is a door. &quot;<font color=#000080>[if the jumble is in Old School]What must be an old wooden trap-door, perhaps for wine-barrels, is partially buried by all that masonry[otherwise]The cellar trap-door is now free of the rubble[end if].</font>&quot; The wooden trap-door is below the Old School. The other side of the trap-door is the Archive Chamber. The trap-door is openable and closed. Instead of opening the trap-door when the jumble is in Old School, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Even the idea of lifting the weight of those columns is tiring.</font>&quot; After going through the trap-door: say &quot;<font color=#000080>You lose your footing, and half jump, half fall down into the cellar.</font>&quot;; continue the action. The trap-door is trapped. <font color=#404040>[Only for the pun, though.</font>] Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>trap</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>trapdoor</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>door</font>&quot; as the trap-door. The trap-door is wood.
<br>

<br>
The jumble of school columns are fixed in place scenery in Old School. Understand &quot;<font color=#000080>column</font>&quot; and &quot;<font color=#000080>masonry</font>&quot; as the jumble. Instead of casting magic missile at the jumble, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Extreme violence isn't the answer to this one.</font>&quot; Understand the command &quot;<font color=#000080>pry</font>&quot; as &quot;<font color=#000080>open</font>&quot;. Effect of casting mend at the jumble: record outcome &quot;<font color=#000080>which - perhaps with an air of smugness - resists all attempt at straightening out</font>&quot;; rule succeeds.
<br>

<br>
Pushing or pulling the jumble is a Samson act. Instead of a Samson act for the first time, say &quot;<font color=#000080>It all looks mighty precarious, with the last of the ceiling-work liable to fall, but if you're sure this is what you want...</font>&quot; Instead of a Samson act: say &quot;<font color=#000080>There is a vast, booming series of reports, the inconsequential sound of these jackstraws of stone smashing down against each other: and then the last remaining slab of ceiling-brace falls. </font>&quot;; if the player is not affected by aerial shield begin; say &quot;<font color=#000080>We could go through a charade of working out [if the player is affected by ironbones]210d8+50[otherwise]420d8+100[end if] damage, but let's simply wind this up in a dignified fashion.</font>&quot;; end the game saying &quot;<font color=#000080>You have been buried</font>&quot;; stop; end if; say &quot;<font color=#000080>Probably never has 'aerial shield' been put to so formidable a challenge, but the enchantment holds, and as the rubble settles all about the yard you half-collapse, trying to catch your breath.

<br>
</font><font color=#000080>That was Old School.</font>&quot;; remove the jumble from play; award 14 points.
