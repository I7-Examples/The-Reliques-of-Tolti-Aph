Understand &quot;<span class="quote">solitaire</span>&quot; as preparing to maze. Check preparing to maze: unless the turn count is 1, say &quot;<span class="quote">Solitaire maze play is only allowed if chosen on the opening round.</span>&quot; instead. Carry out preparing to maze: change the solitaire game count to 1; change the level of the player to 3; change the permanent strength of the player to 16; restore the health of the player; now the player knows magic missile; now the player knows make sanctuary; now the player knows mend; move the old pipe to the player; now the player carries the arrow; now the player knows web; now the player knows aerial shield; move player to the Hedge Archway.</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">Before going west from the Hedge Archway when the solitaire game count is not 0:</p><p class="indent1">end the game saying &quot;<span class="quote">You have left the Maze of Royal Beasts</span>&quot; instead.</p><p class="indent0"></p>
