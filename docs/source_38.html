The maze victory count is a number that varies.</p><p class="indent0">The Hedge Archway is a labyrinth room with shape L0/0-0-1-1-1-0. The Hedge Archway has map legend &quot;<span class="quote">&lt;H&gt;</span>&quot;. &quot;<span class="quote">The Maze is composed of solid, impenetrable hedges that might as well be dungeon walls, and are certainly too high to see over.

Some leaves part of the branch are defined by the Table of Task Leaves. The description of a leaf is &quot;<span class="quote">The leaf unrolls to reveal black writing on its open face: Your task, o mage, is to [</span><span class="substitution">task briefing</span><span class="quote">]. Fail not in this quest: yet, if it must be so, you may tear this leaf to abandon your effort and return here (if you be not in combat at the time), at a permanent cost of 1 STR point. And remember always that if the maze be exhausted, you may never reach your goal... so do not tarry, do not meander.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of examining a leaf which is part of the branch, say &quot;<span class="quote">It is rolled up, as if not quite opened by the sun, and although there is evidently writing inside, you can make little out except the word [</span><span class="substitution">clue word of the noun</span><span class="quote">].</span>&quot; Instead of taking a leaf which is part of the branch, say &quot;<span class="quote">The branch is high enough up that its leaves are just slightly out of reach.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Understand &quot;<span class="quote">tear [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">tear up [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">]</span>&quot; or &quot;<span class="quote">tear [</span><span class="substitution">something</span><span class="quote">] up</span>&quot; as attacking.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of jumping in the Hedge Archway when a leaf is part of the branch:</p><p class="indent1">if the branch is too high, say &quot;<span class="quote">The branch is just too high, even at a jump.
