In Terra Incognita are some chain mail, a lance and a battle axe. A dead badger is in Terra Incognita. &quot;<span class="quote">A dead badger, striped forehead lain over his legs, lies here.

This bric-a-brac is more useful than it seems: the wooden items make convenient "magic missile" foci, while the poor badger allows flesh-focus spells to be cast. There are badgers in the wood I most often go for walks in, and I'm rather fond of them: but they do look inexpressibly sad in death.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  At one time there were more bats, and because many cards don't appear in the hedge maze on level 1, players tended to run into giant bats rather often: one of the play-testers remarked that it seemed a little sad to be wandering around making the giant bat extinct in one its last habitats. Her comments ended up, in mutated form, as the "Outdoorsman" column in the spoof magazine accompanying the game.</span></p>
