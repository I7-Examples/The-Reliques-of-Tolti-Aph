An old wooden dowel rod and a broken-off handle are in Terra Incognita. The dowel and the handle are wood. In Terra Incognita are some chain mail, a lance and a battle axe. A dead badger is in Terra Incognita. &quot;<font color=#000080>A dead badger, striped forehead lain over his legs, lies here. Nothing so terrible seems to have happened to him: only old age.</font>&quot; The dead badger is flesh. Instead of eating the dead badger, say &quot;<font color=#000080>Things are not that desperate yet: and let us hope they never will be.</font>&quot; Effect of casting mend at the dead badger: record outcome &quot;<font color=#000080>but look, if the spell were 'resurrect badger' it would have said so</font>&quot;; rule succeeds.<font color=#404040><sup><a href="#note1">[1]</a></sup></font>

<br>

<A name="note1"><font color=#404040>[1].  This bric-a-brac is more useful than it seems: the wooden items make convenient "magic missile" foci, while the poor badger allows flesh-focus spells to be cast. There are badgers in the wood I most often go for walks in, and I'm rather fond of them: but they do look inexpressibly sad in death.</font><p>
<A name="note2"><font color=#404040>[2].  At one time there were more bats, and because many cards don't appear in the hedge maze on level 1, players tended to run into giant bats rather often: one of the play-testers remarked that it seemed a little sad to be wandering around making the giant bat extinct in one its last habitats. Her comments ended up, in mutated form, as the "Outdoorsman" column in the spoof magazine accompanying the game.</font><p>
