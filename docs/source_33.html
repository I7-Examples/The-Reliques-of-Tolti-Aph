Initially, when none of the labyrinth rooms have been &quot;played&quot; into the maze, all exits are blocked in this way. Solid Rock is also used as a special value meaning that no room is at a given grid position: thus &quot;the room at &lt;1,4,12&gt;&quot; might evaluate to a room present in the maze, or it might evaluate to Solid Rock.]</span></p><p class="indent0">Solid Rock is a room.</p><p class="indent0">To make all labyrinth exits lead to Solid Rock:</p><p class="indent1">repeat with blank room running through labyrinth rooms:</p><p class="indent2">let Sh be the shape of the blank room;</p><p class="indent2">if U part of Sh is 1, change the up exit of blank room to Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent2">if D part of Sh is 1, change the down exit of blank room to Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent2">if N part of Sh is 1, change the north exit of blank room to Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent2">if E part of Sh is 1, change the east exit of blank room to Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent2">if S part of Sh is 1, change the south exit of blank room to Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent2">if W part of Sh is 1, change the west exit of blank room to Solid Rock.</p><p class="indent0">To decide which room is the room at (grid ref - a spatial coordinate):</p><p class="indent1">if grid ref is &lt;0,0,0&gt;:</p><p class="indent2">decide on Solid Rock;</p><p class="indent1">repeat with R running through rooms:</p><p class="indent2">if the grid position of R is grid ref:</p><p class="indent3">decide on R;</p><p class="indent1">decide on Solid Rock.</p>
