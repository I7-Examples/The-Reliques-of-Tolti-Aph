<div class ="notes">
<p><span class="notesheading">Notes</span></p>
<p><a name="note1"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note1ref">[1]</a>.  A device used in testing. The trouble with heavily random games is that when faults are reported, it is sometimes all but impossible to recreate the circumstances, because the right combination of random chances never comes up. This option fixes that.</span></p>
<p><a name="note2"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note2ref">[2]</a>.  A notation for play-testers to use. I prefer to be sent transcripts of play rather than bug reports, and this allows testers to type random remarks in as commands, so that they appear in the transcript.</span></p>
<p><a name="note3"></a><span class="notetext"><a href="#note3ref">[3]</a>.  For testing the Earthquake and Trap hazards in the Maze, which took quite a lot of getting right.</span></p>
